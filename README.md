# TCP_Chat_Room
Python program to implement a TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) chat room based on a client-server architecture. 

We have one server that hosts the chat and multiple clients that connect to it and communicate with each other. For our application, we will use the client-server architecture. This means that we will have multiple clients (the users) and one central server that hosts everything and provides the data for these clients.

One program will be for starting the server and one will be for the client. We will have to run the server first, so that there is a chat, which the clients can connect to. The clients themselves, are not going to directly communicate to each other but via the central server.
